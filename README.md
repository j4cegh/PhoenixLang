# MOVING TO https://github.com/codefox-software/phoenixlang

# PhoenixLang
A programming language that uses [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

# Why?
Why not? XML is easy to use, especially for beginners coming from [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

# What is planned for PhoenixLang?
PhoenixLang originates from the now archived [SillyLang](https://github.com/j4cegh/SillyLang). I'll reimplement and change stuff.
